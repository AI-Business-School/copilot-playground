# Code Completion Exercise Guideline

This document provides guidelines for creating code completion exercises that demonstrate GitHub Copilot's capabilities.

## [Objective]

- Learn how to use GitHub Copilot to complete partial implementations.
- Practice writing guiding code that helps Copilot understand your intent.
- Understand how different comment styles affect Copilot's suggestions.
- Explore variations of implementations for common algorithms.

## [GitHub Copilot Best Practices]

1. Write clear and descriptive comments above functions
2. Use type hints/annotations when possible
3. Start with a good function signature
4. Break down complex tasks into smaller functions
5. Use natural language descriptions in comments
6. Include example inputs/outputs in comments

## [Working with Copilot]

1. Press Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Enter (Mac) to see alternative suggestions
2. Use inline comments to guide Copilot's suggestions
3. Add docstrings/JSDoc comments for better context
4. Test different comment styles to improve suggestions
5. Use // to continue generating more code

## [Instructions]

1. Navigate to the file you want to edit.
2. Use the "Edit with Copilot" feature.
3. Add a JavaScript or Python file if not already present.
4. Write the following prompt in the file: "Complete function in this file."
5. Observe and review the suggestions provided by Copilot.
6. Select the most appropriate completion or modify it as needed.
