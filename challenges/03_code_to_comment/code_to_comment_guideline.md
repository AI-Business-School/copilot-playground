# Code to Comment Exercise Guideline

This exercise demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to generate appropriate comments for existing code.

## [Objective]

- Learn how to use GitHub Copilot to generate meaningful comments for existing code
- Understand how to document algorithms and complex logic
- Practice identifying key aspects of code that need documentation

## [Instructions]

1. Review the provided uncommented code implementations:
   - JavaScript version in `code_to_comment.js`
   - Python version in `code_to_comment.py`

2. Use GitHub Copilot to generate comments that explain:
   - Function purpose and algorithm description
   - Parameter descriptions and their constraints
   - Return value details
   - Time and space complexity
   - Any important implementation details

3. Consider commenting on:
   - The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm concept
   - Key steps in the implementation
   - Performance characteristics
   - Usage examples

4. Verify that the generated comments:
   - Are clear and accurate
   - Follow language-specific documentation standards
   - Provide sufficient detail for other developers

## [Example Output]

The final commented code should help developers understand:
- What the algorithm does
- How it works
- When to use it
- Performance implications
- Input/output expectations
