# Regex Patterns Exercise Guideline

This document provides guidelines for practicing regex pattern generation with GitHub Copilot.

## [Objective]

- Learn how to generate regex patterns for common use cases
- Practice writing clear descriptions that lead to correct regex patterns
- Understand how to test and validate regex patterns
- Master common regex pattern techniques

## [Instructions]

1. Start with a clear description of the pattern you need:

   - What should match?
   - What should not match?
   - Any specific constraints?
   - Required format or structure?

2. Include test cases:

   - Valid matches
   - Invalid matches
   - Edge cases
   - Corner cases

3. Consider pattern requirements:

   - Case sensitivity
   - Multiline matching
   - Global matching
   - Unicode support
   - Capture groups

4. Test and validate:
   - Use the provided test functions
   - Try edge cases
   - Verify performance
   - Check for common pitfalls

## [Best Practices]

1. Start with simple patterns and build up complexity
2. Use named capture groups for clarity
3. Consider performance implications
4. Add comments to explain complex patterns
5. Test with a variety of inputs
6. Consider different regex engine implementations

## [Examples]

See `regex_patterns.js` and `regex_patterns.py` for practical examples of:

- Email validation
- Phone number matching
- URL parsing
- Date format validation
- Custom format matching
