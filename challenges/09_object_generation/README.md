# Object Generation Examples

This directory demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot to generate objects and factories. The examples focus on creating complex objects with validation, behavior, and relationships, encouraging interactive learning through questions and patterns.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to use Copilot to generate object structures
2. Understand factory patterns and object composition
3. Practice creating domain-driven designs
4. Develop skills in object-oriented programming

## Directory Structure

```
javascript/
└── object_generator.js    # JavaScript implementation of object patterns
python/
└── object_generator.py    # Python implementation of object patterns
```

## Examples

The examples include several object patterns:

1. User Management

   - Object validation
   - Default values
   - Preference handling
   - State management

2. Product Inventory

   - Composition patterns
   - Stock management
   - Method generation
   - Tag handling

3. Shopping Cart

   - Complex relationships
   - Calculations
   - State updates
   - Error handling

## Questions to Ask

1. Object Design

   - What properties are needed?
   - How to handle validation?
   - What methods to include?
   - How to manage state?

2. Factory Patterns

   - When to use factories?
   - How to handle defaults?
   - Parameter validation?
   - Object relationships?

3. Object Behavior

   - Instance methods?
   - State changes?
   - Error handling?
   - Side effects?

4. Best Practices

   - Code organization?
   - Documentation?
   - Testing strategies?
   - Error messages?

5. Implementation
   - Language features?
   - Design patterns?
   - Performance impact?
   - Maintainability?

## Tips for Better Objects

1. Design

   - Start with structure
   - Include validation
   - Consider relationships
   - Plan for extension

2. Implementation

   - Use factories
   - Add behavior
   - Handle errors
   - Document usage

3. Validation

   - Check inputs
   - Validate state
   - Handle errors
   - Provide feedback

4. Maintenance
   - Keep it simple
   - Document changes
   - Review regularly
   - Update tests

## What to Observe

1. Object Structure

   - Property types
   - Relationships
   - Validation rules
   - Default values

2. Object Behavior

   - Method design
   - State changes
   - Error handling
