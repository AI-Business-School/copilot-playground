# Comment to Code Exercise Guideline

This document provides guidelines for creating code using comments that demonstrate GitHub Copilot's capabilities.

## [Objective]

- Learn how to write descriptive comments that guide Copilot's code generation
- Understand how to structure comments for different programming languages
- Practice creating clear and specific function requirements
- Explore how different comment styles affect Copilot's suggestions

## [Instructions]

1. Start by writing clear comments that describe:
   - Function name
   - Input parameters and their types
   - Expected return type
   - Function purpose or behavior

2. Use language-appropriate comment styles:
   - JavaScript: Use JSDoc style comments
   - Python: Use docstring or hash comments

3. Be specific about:
   - Data types
   - Edge cases
   - Expected behavior
   - Any constraints or limitations

4. Review and refine the generated code:
   - Check if it matches your requirements
   - Test with different inputs
   - Verify edge cases are handled

## [Examples]

See `comment_to_code.js` and `comment_to_code.py` for practical examples of:
- Array processing functions
- String manipulation
- Object/Dictionary transformations
