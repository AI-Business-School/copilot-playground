# Unit Testing Exercise Guideline

This document provides guidelines for creating comprehensive unit tests using GitHub Copilot.

## [Objective]

- Learn how to write effective unit tests for different types of code
- Practice test case design and coverage analysis
- Understand mocking and test isolation
- Master testing best practices and patterns

## [Instructions]

1. Analyze the Code Under Test:

   - Understand the function/class behavior
   - Identify input parameters and return values
   - Note any dependencies or side effects
   - Consider edge cases and error conditions

2. Design Test Cases:

   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error cases and exception handling
   - Performance considerations

3. Write Test Functions:

   - Clear test function names
   - Proper test setup and teardown
   - Meaningful assertions
   - Comprehensive error messages

4. Consider Test Coverage:
   - Line coverage
   - Branch coverage
   - Path coverage
   - Exception coverage

## [Best Practices]

1. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Test one thing per test function
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Keep tests independent
6. Write maintainable test code

## [Examples]

See `unit_testing.js` and `unit_testing.py` for practical examples of:

- Function unit tests
- Class unit tests
- Integration tests
- Mock object usage
- Test coverage analysis
