Exercise: Advanced Sorting Algorithm Implementation

Task:
Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines the benefits of Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
The algorithm should automatically choose the best sorting strategy based on the input size and characteristics.

Requirements:
1. Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that:
   - Uses Quick Sort for smaller arrays (threshold to be determined)
   - Uses Merge Sort for larger arrays
   - Handles different data types (numbers, strings)
   - Includes proper error handling
   - Has optimal space complexity

2. The implementation should include:
   - Type hints
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Memory efficiency considerations
   - Detailed documentation

3. Additional Features:
   - Support for custom comparison functions
   - Ability to sort in both ascending and descending order
   - Handling of edge cases (empty arrays, single elements, duplicates)
   - Performance metrics tracking

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Test with various input sizes
   - Test with different data types
   - Test edge cases
   - Benchmark performance

Compare how each AI model:
- Structures the solution
- Handles edge cases
- Implements error handling
- Documents the code
- Optimizes performance
- Provides testing strategies
