## Best Practices

1. Review Request:

   - Specify review focus
   - Include context
   - Highlight critical areas
   - Define review scope

2. Iterative Review:

   - Start with high-level review
   - Deep dive into issues
   - Follow-up on fixes
   - Verify improvements

3. Review Process:
   - Security first
   - Quality second
   - Documentation third
   - Implementation guidance

## Example Workflow

1. Initial Review Request:

   ```python
   # Request: "Review this code for:
   # - Security vulnerabilities
   # - Performance issues
   # - Error handling
